/* To be honest: i dont know what to put in here. 
But if you'll use the list pager and you want to style the gui than you'll be happy 
to have the possibility to easily assign CSS - i'm kind of sure ;-) 

Ohh and if you don't want to style your list pager and also don't want this CSS file to show up 
than just set ApListPager->cssFile=false; and the CSS file will not be included in your page.
